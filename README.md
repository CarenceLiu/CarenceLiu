## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year master student in Peking University, majoring in computer science.

I'm interested in network and LLM. Currently, I'm an intern in 360 to train a multimodel for solving chemistry problems. Meanwhile, I also develop some strategies for stock and crypto markets. Before this, I had internships in Huawei, Zhuoshi Quant and Bytedance.
